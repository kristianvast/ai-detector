# AI Detector — Web

The frontend for the AI Detector project. Built with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

> **Status: In development.** Not yet ready for production use.

## What it does

- Displays a live view of active detection streams.
- Shows a history of past detections with images and video clips.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## Building

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The default build targets the Windows executable package. To build the Docker/Node server variant locally, use `AI_DETECTOR_WEB_TARGET=docker pnpm build`. That same target also controls whether the server reads `config.json`, `app.json`, and `detections/` from the working directory or next to the packaged executable.

## Docker

From the repository root:

```bash
docker compose up -d aidetector web
```

The container serves the app on [http://localhost](http://localhost). In Compose, the `web` service reuses `aidetector`'s mounted `config.json`, `app.json`, input files, and `detections/` via `volumes_from`.
