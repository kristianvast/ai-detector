# AI Detector

Watches one or more video streams or files, and sends you an alert the moment something is detected — a person, an animal, a vehicle, whatever your model is trained to find.

Detection works in two stages:
1. **YOLO** — a fast AI model that scans every frame looking for objects.
2. **VLM** *(optional)* — a smarter AI (like Gemini or GPT-5) that double-checks the detection by looking at the footage and answering a question you define, e.g. *"Is there really a cow mounting another cow?"*. This dramatically reduces false alerts.

Confirmed detections can be sent to **Telegram**, saved to **disk**, or posted to a **webhook**.

## Getting Started

### Option 1 — Windows Executable (recommended for most users)

👉 **[Download from the Releases page](https://github.com/ESchouten/ai-detector/releases)**

Pick the right file for your hardware:

| File | GPU |
| :--- | :-- |
| `aidetector-winml-<version>.exe` | Windows 11 with any GPU |
| `aidetector-cuda130-<version>.exe` | Windows 10 with NVIDIA RTX 3000 series or newer |
| `aidetector-cuda126-<version>.exe` | Windows 10 with NVIDIA RTX 2000 series or older |
| `aidetector-osx-<version>` | macOS (CPU / Apple Silicon) |

> **Not sure which to pick?** Start with `winml` on Windows. Use a `cuda` build only if you know your NVIDIA setup matches that CUDA version.

**Setup:**
1. Create a folder, e.g. `C:\aidetector`, and move the downloaded `.exe` into it.
2. In that same folder, create a `config.json` file (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).
3. Double-click the `.exe` — a terminal window opens showing detection logs.

On first run with no `config.json` present, a template is generated automatically. Fill it in and run again.

> **Tip:** Keep the terminal window open while the detector is running. If it closes immediately, there is an error in your `config.json` — check for missing quotes `"` or commas `,`.

### Option 2 — Docker

Useful if you are on Linux, a NAS, or want the detector to restart automatically after a reboot. From the `example/` folder:

```bash
cd example
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f aidetector web
```

The example Compose stack also starts the web UI on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Don't have Docker?** [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) — it's free.

### Option 3 — Development (advanced)

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --extra default

# Run the detector (config.json must be in the current directory)
uv run --extra default main

# Sync JSON schema with the Pydantic data models
uv run generate-schema
```

---

## Configuration

All settings go in `config.json`. The file supports JSON Schema, so if you use VS Code it will give you autocomplete and describe every option as you type.

You can run multiple independent detectors in the same file — useful if you have several cameras or want different alert rules per camera.

```json
{
  "onnx":   { ... },
  "health": { ... },
  "detectors": [
    {
      "detection": { ... },
      "yolo":      { ... },
      "vlm":       { ... },
      "exporters": { ... }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Top-level fields

| Field       | Default      | Description |
| :---------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `detectors` | **Required** | List of detector definitions. Each detector can watch one or more sources and use its own YOLO/VLM/exporter settings. |
| `onnx`      |              | Optional ONNX Runtime configuration. Lets you pin a provider and control Windows ML registration. |
| `health`    |              | Optional HTTP healthcheck pinger. Useful for watchdogs, uptime tools, or Home Assistant-style monitoring. |

---

### `detection` — What to watch

| Field             | Default      | Description |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `source`          | **Required** | Path to a video file, or an RTSP/HTTP stream URL. Use a list `[ ]` for multiple sources. |
| `interval`        | `0`          | How many seconds to wait between processed frames. Set to `0` to process every frame. Useful to reduce load on slow machines. |
| `frame_retention` | `30`         | How many recent frames to keep in memory per source so detections can include earlier context. |

**Examples:**
```json
"source": "rtsp://192.168.1.10/stream"
"source": ["rtsp://camera1", "rtsp://camera2"]
"source": "videos/clip.mp4"
```

---

### `yolo` — Object detection model

This is the fast first-pass AI that scans every frame. Without a YOLO model, the detector simply passes all frames through to the VLM or exporters.

| Field                   | Default      | Description |
| :---------------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `model`                 | **Required** | URL or local path to a YOLO model file (`.pt` or `.onnx`). |
| `confidence`            | `0`          | How confident YOLO must be (0–1) before counting something as a detection. `0.8` means 80% sure. You can also set different thresholds per class — see tip below. |
| `time_max`              | `60`         | Maximum duration in seconds to group frames into one event. If a detection runs longer than this, a new event starts. |
| `timeout`               | `5`          | Seconds of no detections before the current event is considered over. |
| `cooldown`              | `0`          | Seconds to wait after finishing one event before starting a new one. Prevents repeat alerts for the same ongoing situation. Can be set per class. |
| `include_trailing_time` | `1`          | Seconds of extra footage to include after the last detected frame so the event does not end too abruptly. |
| `frames_min`            | `6` / `3`    | How many frames in a row must match before the event counts. Default is `6` when `torch.cuda.is_available()` is true, otherwise `3`. |
| `imgsz`                 | `640`        | The image size fed into the model. Higher values are more accurate but slower. Most models expect `640`. |
| `strategy`              | `"LATEST"`   | Which frames to evaluate: `"LATEST"` uses only the most recent, `"ALL"` evaluates every frame. |

> **Tip — per-class confidence thresholds:**
> Instead of a single number, you can give each class its own threshold:
> ```json
> "confidence": { "person": 0.85, "car": 0.6 }
> ```
> Only the classes you list are evaluated — everything else is ignored.

> **Tip — per-class cooldowns:**
> ```json
> "cooldown": { "person": 60, "car": 30 }
> ```

### `vlm` *(optional)* — AI double-check

After YOLO flags something, a Vision Language Model looks at the footage and answers a question you write. Only if the answer seems positive does the detection get exported. This step is optional but greatly reduces false alarms.

Can be a single object or a list. If you provide a list, the VLMs are tried in order until one succeeds.

| Field      | Default      | Description |
| :--------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `prompt`   | **Required** | The question to ask about the footage, e.g. `"Is there a person in this video?"` |
| `model`    | **Required** | The AI model to use, e.g. `"gemini/gemini-2.0-flash"`. Can also be a list of model names for provider fallback. Supports any model from [LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). |
| `key`      |              | API key for the model provider (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.). |
| `url`      |              | Custom API endpoint, if you're running a local model. |
| `strategy` | `"VIDEO"`    | `"VIDEO"` — sends the full detection clip to the AI. `"IMAGE"` — sends only a single frame. Video is more accurate but costs more tokens. |

---

### `exporters` *(optional)* — Where to send alerts

You can combine multiple exporters. Each exporter key can be either a single object or a list of objects if you want to send to multiple Telegram chats, webhooks, or disk destinations.

`confidence` on any exporter can be either:
- a single number such as `0.7`
- a per-class map such as `{ "person": 0.8, "car": 0.6 }`

#### 💾 Disk (`disk`)

Saves detection images or frames to a folder on your machine.

| Field             | Default      | Description |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `directory`       |              | Folder path under `detections/` to save files into, e.g. `"mounts"`. If omitted, the exporter uses the best-matching class name as the directory. |
| `strategy`        | `"BEST"`     | `"BEST"` saves only the highest-confidence frame. `"ALL"` saves every frame from the event. |
| `confidence`      |              | Minimum confidence required to save. Leave empty to save everything. |
| `export_rejected` | `true`       | Whether to also save detections that were rejected by the VLM. |

#### 📱 Telegram (`telegram`)

Sends an alert to a Telegram chat. The bot can include images or a video clip.

> **How to get a bot token:** Talk to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram and follow the steps to create a bot. It gives you a token.
>
> **How to get your chat ID:** Add your bot to a chat, send it a message, then open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates` in your browser — the `chat.id` field is your chat ID.

| Field             | Default      | Description |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `token`           | **Required** | Your Telegram bot token. |
| `chat`            | **Required** | The Telegram chat or user ID to send alerts to. |
| `confidence`      |              | Minimum confidence required to send. Leave empty to always send. |
| `alert_every`     | `1`          | Only send a notification sound every Nth detection. `1` = every time, `5` = every 5th. |
| `include_plot`    | `false`      | Include the full frame with a detection box drawn on it. |
| `include_crop`    | `false`      | Include a cropped image of just the detected object. |
| `include_video`   | `true`       | Include an MP4 clip of the detection sequence. |
| `video_width`     | `1280`       | Width of the video clip in pixels. Height is calculated automatically. |
| `video_crf`       | `28`         | Video quality (0–51). Lower = better quality, larger file. `28` is a good default. |
| `export_rejected` | `false`      | Whether to also send detections rejected by the VLM. |

#### 🔗 Webhook (`webhook`)

Posts detection data to an HTTP endpoint. Useful for integrating with other systems.

| Field             | Default      | Description |
| :---------------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `url`             | **Required** | The URL to POST to when a detection occurs. |
| `token`           |              | Authorization token sent in the request headers. |
| `confidence`      |              | Minimum confidence required to trigger. Leave empty to always trigger. |
| `data_type`       | `"binary"`   | How image/video data is encoded in the payload: `"binary"` or `"base64"`. |
| `data_max`        |              | Maximum payload size in bytes. The image is compressed if it exceeds this. |
| `include_plot`    | `false`      | Include the full frame with detection overlay. |
| `include_crop`    | `true`       | Include a cropped image of the detected area. |
| `include_video`   | `false`      | Include an MP4 clip of the detection sequence. |
| `video_width`     | `1280`       | Width of the video clip in pixels. |
| `video_crf`       | `28`         | Video quality (0–51). Lower = better quality, larger file. |
| `export_rejected` | `false`      | Whether to also POST detections rejected by the VLM. |

### `health` *(optional)* — External heartbeat

Sends a simple periodic HTTP request while the detector is running. This is useful if another system wants to verify that the process is still alive.

| Field      | Default      | Description |
| :--------- | :----------- | :---------- |
| `url`      | **Required** | The URL to ping. |
| `method`   | `"GET"`      | HTTP method to use: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, or `HEAD`. |

| `headers`  |              | Optional HTTP headers map. |
| `body`     |              | Optional request body sent as raw text. |

---

### `onnx` *(optional)* — ONNX Runtime behavior

These settings control how the executable configures ONNX Runtime before loading a YOLO model.

| Field      | Default  | Description |
| :--------- | :------- | :---------- |
| `provider` |          | Optional provider name to force, e.g. `"CUDAExecutionProvider"` or `"CPUExecutionProvider"`. If omitted, ONNX Runtime uses its normal provider order. |
| `winml`    | `true`   | Only relevant for the `windowsml` build. If `true`, the app tries to register Windows ML execution providers automatically. |
| `opset`    | `20`     | ONNX opset used when exporting a `.pt` model to ONNX. Lower values can improve compatibility with some runtimes. |
